GAME DESCRIPTION:

# what tf am i lookin at boi?

**Escape From Morocco** is a small unserious arcade type game made for **Seezee**'s birthday,
similiar to [Gradius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius) or [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga),
flying through environments and destroying enemies, trying to reach the end of the level.
**Note: This game's story and characters WILL be VERY hard to understand if you're not at least aware of who Seezee or any other featured people/characters are.**

# inspirations

## Escape From Morocco's menus, gameplay etc. are inspired by other games and media, for example:

The name of the game is inspired by the song "Escape From Poland",
from [Vs Bamber & Davey V2.5](https://glitchdotsmh.itch.io/bnd) **(Note: As of now the song is only playable in the [April Fools spin-off](https://gamebanana.com/mods/585254))**
The country was changed to Morocco because that's Seezee's nationality!
