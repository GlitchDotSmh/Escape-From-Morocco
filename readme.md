*"Be Bird."*

## What is this game??
**Escape From Morocco** is an unserious endless Shoot 'em up arcade game made for **Seezee**'s birthday,\
similiar to [Gradius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius) or [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga),\
flying through environments and destroying enemies, trying to reach the end of the level.\
Proudly coded on [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org/)!\
*"To be proud is to be cringe and childish" - Sun Tzu*\
**Note: This game's story and characters WILL be VERY hard to understand if you're not at least aware of who Seezee or any other featured people/characters are.**

## Where can I play?
The game is available to play here:\
\
[GameJolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjP2hLxUaKs) (Web, Medals, API Integration) **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND INTENDED EXPERIENCE**\
[Itch.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjP2hLxUaKs) (Web, Desktop) **Note: Game will (optionally) auto-update with the [Itch.io Desktop App](https://itch.io/app)**

## Any inspirations?
Menus, gameplay etc. are inspired by other games and media, for example:\
\
The name of the game is inspired by the song "Escape From Poland",\
from [Vs Bamber & Davey V2.5](https://glitchdotsmh.itch.io/bnd),\
which in itself is based off of "Escape From California" from [Vs Dave & Bambi](https://gamebanana.com/mods/43201).\
**(Note: As of now the song is only playable in the [April Fools spin-off](https://gamebanana.com/mods/585254))**\
The country was changed to Morocco because that's Seezee's nationality!\

# HOW TO USE & COMPILE:

## How to open the project file:
1. You need to download [Turbowarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/) (Instructions on the website)\
**MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON THE LATEST PUBLIC VERSION.**

2. After downloading Turbowarp correctly, the `.sb3` file should get it's icon,\
![Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/606810db-7222-4dc6-ae60-8fbbd06921de)\
but don't worry if it didn't, it might've not updated.\
You can either:
- Double-Click the `Escape From Morocco.sb3` file, which should automatically open Turbowarp,\
and **if opening Turbowarp after freshly installing, might ask what to open the file with, simply navigate to where you installed Turbowarp and make it the default program.**\
**This should also update the icon if it hasn't before**
- Open Turbowarp, drag & drop the `Escape From Morocco.sb3` file into the Turbowarp window
- Open Turbowarp, click the following buttons:
`File` (in the top left) > `Load from your computer` > `Escape From Morocco.sb3`

3. After opening the project file in any of those ways, you will get a `Extension Security` pop-up,\
This is a security measure to prevent loading unwanted or harmful Extensions.\
Rest assured that every Extension used is from a trusted source, [Sharkpool](https://sharkpools-extensions.vercel.app/).\
**You need to select the `Run without sandbox` option, otherwise every Extension will not load and the project will break.**\
This pop-up will show up for every single Extension, again, for security.\
There isn't a lot of them, just keep pressing the `Allow` button until the pop-up is gone.

4. You can now mess with the project or play it in the editor to your heart's content!

## How to compile/package the game:
1. With the project file open, click the following buttons:\
`File` (in the top left) > `Package project`
2. A new window called `TurboWarp Packager` will show up.\
Scroll to the very bottom, click `Import Settings` and select the `efm-packSetts.json` file.
3. **If you know what you're doing,** you can change the packager settings to your hearts content.
4. Go to the very bottom, select your Environment, and hit the `Package` button (or `Preview`, if you'd like to test it first)
5. Select where you want to save the packaged/compiled project.
